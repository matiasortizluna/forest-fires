# About the project

The project's objetive was to appy Data mining techniques to predict the cause of a set of fires that occur in Portugal and, thus, better support the decision to take preventive measures to avoid tragedy. 

The ICFN - Nature and Forest Conservation Institute has a record of the forest fires that occurred in Portugal for several years, which information is located in the file fires_train.csv, where there is data on reported forest fires during 2014 and 2015, for which the cause is known. For each fire, there is information such as the site, the alert date/hour, the extinction date/hour, the affected area and the cause type (intentional, natural, negligent, rekindling or unknown).

This practical assignment aimed to build a machine learning model to predict the cause type of a forest fire: intentional or non-intentional.

Data Understanding and Preparation: This task involves summarizing and visualizing the data to provide valuable insights. Consider questions that could be interesting to check with the available data and provide answers using textual summaries or data visualization. Based on this analysis, you should also check if it is necessary to carry out any data clean-up and pre-processing steps.

Predictive Modelling: From the available data, you should define the data set used for the classification task at hand. Different models should be considered, and the choice of the final model should be justified.
